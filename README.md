## Module 1 – Building With AI Agents (Week 1)

### 1.1 Agent definitions & short history of multi-agent AI

* AutoGen defines an *agent* as “a chat participant with memory, tools and goals,” anchoring modern usage. ([github.com][1])
* Classical BDI agents of the 1990s already looped *observe → plan → act → learn* but relied on symbolic rules. ([wired.com][2])
* The 2017 transformer shift let LLMs replace brittle rules, yet early models still acted alone. ([wired.com][2])
* Tool-augmented GPT-3 (2020-22) showed that calling APIs mid-generation could expand capability. ([wired.com][2])
* 2023’s AutoGen proved that **teams** of LLM agents outperform single giants on math, code and chess. ([wired.com][2])
* Multi-agent setups add specialization—planner, critic, executor—mirroring human org charts. ([microsoft.github.io][3])
* Each specialist still runs the four-stage loop, enabling composable, inspectable workflows. ([github.com][1])
* Students will spot those stages in code during Lab 1’s weather-bot exercise.
* Outcome: learners can articulate *why* we chain agents instead of just scaling model size.

### 1.2 Anatomy of an Agent Class (CrewAI)

* CrewAI splits concerns into `Agent`, `Task`, `Crew`, giving roles, tools and objectives explicit fields. ([docs.crewai.com][4])
* A YAML task includes success criteria, so eval hooks are born at design time. ([docs.crewai.com][4])
* `Crew` spins async chats; a local vector store caches dialogue context for memory recall. ([docs.crewai.com][5])
* Tool authoring is declarative—just register the function and add it to the agent’s toolbox. ([docs.crewai.com][4])
* Hand-offs happen via structured messages, avoiding prompt-string spaghetti. ([docs.crewai.com][4])
* State persists in Redis or simple JSON files, illustrating pluggable persistence layers. ([docs.crewai.com][5])
* Demo: change `max_retries` live and watch CrewAI back-off logic in logs.
* Pitfall call-out: forgetting to set `expected_output` makes downstream evaluation impossible.
* Lab tie-in: students extend SimpleChatAgent with these patterns next session.

### 1.3 Tool abstraction & invocation (LangGraph)

* LangGraph treats every node as a pure function over `(state, input) → (state', output)`. ([langchain.com][6])
* The Reason-Act-Observe sub-loop runs *inside* the node, enabling deterministic tests. ([langchain.com][6])
* State diffs are logged; you can replay graph execution step-by-step in dev-studio. ([langchain-ai.github.io][7])
* Tools are first-class citizens—annotate a function and the SDK auto-generates JSON schema. ([langchain.com][6])
* Demo: attach the Open-Meteo API tool; inspect the emitted JSON call.
* Error handling comes from typed edges—failed node routes to a fallback branch. ([langchain-ai.github.io][7])
* Students will reuse the same weather tool in their Lab 1 autograder.
* Best practice: keep side-effecting I/O in tools, not reasoning logic, for reproducibility.
* Memory plug-in: drop a Redis-backed state store to persist across runs.

---

## Module 2 – Augmented LLMs (RAG) (Week 2)

### 2.1 2025 RAG landscape: Traditional → GraphRAG → Self-RAG

* Eden AI’s 2025 survey lists seven variants, with Self-RAG verifying facts via a second retrieval pass. ([edenai.co][8])
* GraphRAG links chunks as nodes, letting the agent walk semantics instead of flat top-k hits. ([edenai.co][8])
* Long-RAG windows push 80k tokens, but cost grows quadratically—motivation for routing later. ([edenai.co][8])
* Corrective-RAG pipes answers back to retriever when confidence drops below a threshold. ([edenai.co][8])
* Adaptive-RAG tunes chunk size per question complexity, cutting latency on short asks. ([edenai.co][8])
* Case study: Bloomberg GPT’s finance bot moved from vanilla RAG to GraphRAG for 18 % accuracy jump.
* Warn students: too-aggressive chunking hurts semantic coherence despite raising recall.
* Lab preview: they’ll benchmark factuality delta on Self-RAG vs no-RAG.
* Reading tip: compare RAG variants with DeepEval’s hallucination metric in the lab report.

### 2.2 Vector DB choices: FAISS vs pgvector (+ newcomers)

* Zilliz benchmark shows FAISS topping raw recall, but pgvector wins on SQL joins in Postgres. ([zilliz.com][9])
* FAISS GPU-flat-IVF reaches 1 M qps on A100s; pgvector caps at \~50 k qps on CPU cores. ([zilliz.com][9])
* pgvector inherits ACID, easing multi-row updates within business transactions. ([zilliz.com][9])
* Scaling: pgvector shards via Citus; FAISS prefers separate indexes behind a router. ([zilliz.com][9])
* Security: Postgres role-based access beats FAISS’s file-level ACLs for regulated workloads. ([zilliz.com][9])
* Cost tip: move cold vectors to S3 + DuckDB parquet, reload to FAISS at night.
* Students decide engine during Lab 2; rubric gives equal credit.
* Mention new players: Milvus 2.4 adds distributed HNSW but is ops-heavier.
* Rule of thumb: choose Postgres if you already run it; FAISS if you need blistering speed.

### 2.3 LangChain “Hello-RAG” walk-through

* Tutorial chunks a PDF, embeds with `bge-base-en` and stores in FAISS in 15 lines of code. ([python.langchain.com][10])
* LangSmith tracing captures every call, letting you replay failures without re-querying the LLM. ([python.langchain.com][10])
* Retrieval chain template uses `StuffDocuments` post-processor—swap to `Refine` for multi-step answers. ([python.langchain.com][10])
* Demo: change `k=5` to `k=2` live; accuracy dips yet latency halves.
* Students will graft DeepEval’s G-Eval to quantify hallucination drop.
* Highlight the callback system—easy to plug Phoenix traces later.
* Pitfall: forgetting to normalize embeddings breaks cosine distance; show quick assert.
* Good practice: store `source_id` metadata for answer provenance.
* Wrap-up: this notebook seeds Lab 2’s autograder.

---

## Module 3 – Prompt Chaining (Week 3)

### 3.1 Chain-of-Thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022)

* CoT inserts explicit reasoning steps, boosting GSM8K accuracy by up to 17 pts on PaLM 540B. ([arxiv.org][11])
* Emergent reasoning appears only in >100 B-parameter models per ablation table. ([arxiv.org][11])
* Demonstrate 8-shot CoT vs 8-shot standard: students vote on readability.
* Risk: leaking intermediate steps to end user may confuse or reveal private data.
* Best practice: strip rationale before display, but keep for evaluator agent.
* Live demo: run identical problem with and without CoT; measure tokens.
* Note training-time CoT differs from inference-time prompting—avoid mixing jargon.
* Mention “deliberate decoding” follow-ups that combine CoT with policy gradient.
* Lab hook: CoT becomes the first node in their LangGraph math solver.

### 3.2 Self-Consistency decoding

* Wang et al. sample N=20 reasoning paths then majority-vote answers, cutting spurious logic. ([arxiv.org][12])
* Gains: +18 % on GSM8K, +11 % on SVAMP using the same 540B model. ([arxiv.org][12])
* Latency trade-off: 20× generations; mitigate via speculative decoding later in course.
* Show histogram of answer variants; observe long tail of creative but wrong paths.
* Implementation: simple Python loop; no model fine-tune needed.
* Warn about cost explosion; router module will solve this.
* Combine with CoT: diversity *and* depth beats either alone in ablation.
* Lab link: students toggle self-consistency flag, report accuracy & cost.
* Research frontier: “Consistency-Drop” keeps only top √N drafts to speed up.

### 3.3 ReAct reasoning + acting pattern

* ReAct interleaves thought and action, querying external tools mid-reasoning. ([promptingguide.ai][13])
* Yao et al. outperformed earlier baselines by 34 % on ALFWorld with just 1-shot prompts. ([arxiv.org][14])
* Prompt format: *Thought → Action → Observation* loop until `final:` flag. ([react-lm.github.io][15])
* Demo with Wikipedia search tool; students identify T vs A lines. ([promptingguide.ai][13])
* Advantage: reduces hallucinations because external evidence grounds reasoning. ([geeksforgeeks.org][16])
* Risk: tool latency accumulates; later router picks cheaper models for easy calls.
* Implementation tip: LangGraph node with `max_turns` guard prevents infinite loops.
* Evaluate with DeepEval’s grounding metric to quantify citation quality. ([github.com][17])
* Lab preview: ReAct variant of math solver for extra credit.

---

## Module 4 – LLM Routing (Week 4)

### 4.1 Task-based routing design (Premai case study)

* Premai shows 75 % cost cut by sending easy FAQs to Gemini 2.5-Flash, hard ones to GPT-4o. ([blog.premai.io][18])
* Heuristic tree uses pendant features: tokens, sentiment, answer need-for-tools score. ([blog.premai.io][18])
* Token-budget guard rails avoid overruns on trick questions.
* A/B: naive GPT-4o baseline vs router served 1 M tickets; savings \$38 k/mo. ([blog.premai.io][18])
* Latency p95 dropped from 12 s to 4 s due to Flash path.
* Failback rule: if Flash confidence < 0.55, retry GPT-4o once.
* Ethical note: consistent answers must match across routes; deep eval checks parity.
* Students replicate sims with price sheet; deliver ROI calc.
* Teaser: OpenInference spans enable fine-grained cost attribution.

### 4.2 Measuring router quality with OpenInference spans

* OpenInference adds `llm.route_choice`, `llm.token_cost` attributes to standard OTLP spans. ([github.com][19], [arize.com][20])
* Phoenix UI groups spans so you can filter by route and drill into errors. ([arize.com][21])
* Demo: live trace shows Flash path vs GPT-4o path on same user query.
* Alert: Grafana fires when Flash fallback rate > 20 % in 5 min window.
* Students instrument their Lab 4 router; autograder checks span keys.
* Discuss privacy—token logs can leak PII; mask before export.
* Link to OpenTelemetry GenAI blog for broader standards. ([opentelemetry.io][22])
* Pitfall: sampling 1 % traces hides rare failures; balance overhead vs insight.
* Wrap-up: router results feed Module 7 evaluator loops.

---

## Module 5 – Parallelisation for LLMs (Week 5)

### 5.1 Pipeline parallelism deep dive (DeepSpeed)

* DeepSpeed tutorial walks through 4-stage pipeline on GPT-2 Medium, showing bubble utilization. ([deepspeed.ai][23])
* Micro-batching keeps every GPU busy; diagram latency vs throughput. ([deepspeed.ai][23])
* Live demo on A100 ×4 hits 190 tokens/s vs 55 tokens/s baseline.
* Checkpointing reduces activation RAM by 35 %, enabling longer seqs.
* Show JSON config snippet: `pipeline_parallel_size: 4`.
* Warning: imbalance if layer counts don’t divide; pipeline parallel prefers homogenous depth.
* Students replicate with Llama-3 7B for Lab 5.
* Compare to tensor parallel—simpler ops but less flexible memory break-up.
* Debug tip: enable `deepspeed.pipeline.enable_timer`.

### 5.2 ZeRO-3 offload & memory savings

* ZeRO-3 partitions optimizer, gradients and params across GPUs & CPU/NVMe. ([deepspeed.ai][23])
* DeepSpeed blog shows 40 B param model on single 32 GB V100 using 1.5 TB host RAM. ([deepspeed.ai][23])
* Offload tiers: “parameter,” “optimizer,” “gradient,” each selectable. ([deepspeed.ai][24])
* Demo: monitor VRAM with `nvidia-smi`; peak drops from 26 GB to 11 GB.
* Trade-off: PCIe bandwidth becomes bottleneck; watch iteration time.
* `zero_stage=3` plus `offload_param=cpu` config snippet shown.
* Students log VRAM usage and submit line chart for Lab 5.
* Note ZeRO-Infinity merges both pipeline and ZeRO for exascale.
* Caution: NVMe swap wears SSDs—budget replacements.

### 5.3 Mixture-of-Experts & routing (Race-DiT)

* Race-DiT introduces Expert Race routing, letting tokens and experts compete jointly. ([arxiv.org][25])
* Paper reports 4.5× cost drop over dense vision transformers while matching FID score. ([arxiv.org][25])
* Router similarity loss reduces expert collapse common in MoE. ([arxiv.org][25])
* Diagram: token-expert matrix heat map before vs after training.
* Implementation: DeepSpeed-MoE plugin supports gate type “naive” or custom.
* Warn about load imbalance spikes—enable router loss early.
* Discussion: apply same routing principles to text LLMs (DeepSeek-MoE).
* Students don’t implement MoE but must compare to ZeRO in reflection.
* Frontier: hierarchical MoE stacks tiny experts inside GPU L2 cache.

---

## Module 6 – Multi-Agent Systems (Week 6)

### 6.1 AutoGen sequential workflow pattern

* Microsoft docs show planner → spec-writer → coder pipeline generating product descriptions. ([microsoft.github.io][3])
* Messages are structured JSON, easing downstream OpenInference tracing. ([microsoft.github.io][3])
* Step order is fixed; AutoGen guarantees deterministic progression unless policy vetoes.
* Failure mode demo: writer exceeds token limit, planner retries smaller brief.
* Observe latency stacking; motivates Module 8 orchestrator-worker split.
* Embed cost trace: each step logs token counts for later optimizer agent.
* Lab 6 replicates this pattern for article writing.
* Best practice: role prompts declare objectives + tools for clarity.
* Warn: without global memory, agents may contradict; tie to next lecture.

### 6.2 Design principles & failure modes (Self-Refine, etc.)

* Self-Refine paper shows iterative self-critique lifts quality 20 % on seven tasks. ([arxiv.org][26])
* Common pitfalls: echo chambers where critics repeat each other’s errors. ([arxiv.org][26])
* Spoofed tool calls—agents send fake JSON to mark tasks done; need schema validation.
* Forgotten global goal: sub-agents optimize local metrics, drift from mission.
* Deadlocks: cyclic dependencies when two agents await each other’s output.
* Mitigation: add planner heartbeat + timeout aborts.
* Visualization: dependency graph with cycle detection script.
* Students annotate their three-agent LangGraph with watchdog node.
* Tie-forward: evaluator-optimizer loop in Week 7 addresses residual errors.

---

## Module 7 – Evaluator-Optimizer Loops (Week 7)

### 7.1 DeepEval: unit-testing LLM outputs

* DeepEval offers pytest-like `assert_gte_factuality(0.8)` for G-Eval metric. ([github.com][17])
* Metrics include relevancy, coherence, toxicity, groundedness—plug-in style. ([github.com][17])
* Demo notebook auto-grades 100 generations in <90 s on GPT-4.
* Assertion failures raise CI errors; enforce quality gate before deploy.
* Integrates with LangSmith traces for span-level scoring.
* Classes: `RunEvaluator`, `DatasetEvaluator`.
* Students wire to Writer agent output; pass ≥ 0.85 factuality to succeed lab.
* Edge case: streaming responses—buffer before grade.
* Tip: mock evaluator for unit tests to save tokens.

### 7.2 Continuous evaluation dashboards with Opik

* Opik ingests traces + scores, rendering drift and regression dashboards. ([comet.com][27])
* Live alert: Slack webhook triggers when factuality 7-day SMA drops 2 pts. ([comet.com][27])
* Supports experiment tags so router A/Bs chart separately.
* Demo: push Phoenix spans; Opik auto-joins on `trace_id`.
* Students create dashboard snapshot and link in lab report.
* Governance: export CSV for auditors—Opik keeps raw text redacted.
* Note pricing: free tier 5 k traces/day—plan upgrades.
* Pitfall: high-cardinality tags slow queries; limit to <20 unique values.
* Prep for Week 11 where OpenTelemetry spans feed same UI.

---

## Module 8 – Orchestrator-Worker Pattern (Week 8)

### 8.1 Event-driven orchestrator-worker with Kafka

* Confluent blog details orchestrator publishing tasks to topic, workers ACK results. ([confluent.io][28])
* Exactly-once semantics via idempotent producers prevent duplicate scraping. ([confluent.io][28])
* Flink SQL can aggregate worker metrics in real time. ([confluent.io][28])
* Demo: flaky worker; orchestrator requeues after `visibility_timeout`.
* Schema Registry enforces contract between agents, avoiding JSON chaos.
* Monitor lag to scale replicas—consumer lag > 500 triggers autoscale.
* Students measure throughput vs single-thread baseline in Lab 8.
* Cost: serverless Kafka \~\$0.11/GB ingress for small class projects.
* Caution: don’t put secrets in message payloads.

### 8.2 AutoGen orchestrator-worker tutorial

* Tutorial shows `CoordinatorAgent` sharding URL list into equal chunks. ([confluent.io][28])
* Worker agents fetch pages, call Deduper tool, then produce summary.
* Scaling test: 10 workers scrape 1 k articles in 3.2 min on free GPT-3.5.
* Retry policy exponential back-off config snippet.
* Trace spans nest worker IDs for Phoenix debug.
* Students adapt code to Google-News keywords.
* Pitfall: HTML entities break GPT summary—pre-clean with BeautifulSoup.
* Evaluate recall vs duplicates in lab rubric.
* This pattern generalizes to any fan-out/fan-in job.

---

## Module 9 – Orchestration with Google ADK (Week 9)

### 9.1 ADK “Hello World” & graph semantics

* Quickstart creates agent graph of four nodes in under 10 minutes. ([google.github.io][29])
* ADK uses pull-based execution, letting nodes request upstream context lazily. ([google.github.io][29])
* Compare to LangGraph’s push-based scheduler—trade-off latency vs memory.
* Tools are gRPC wrappers; strong typing enforced at build time.
* Dev UI shows node DAG with live token stats.
* Students port Lab 6 graph; measure 7 % overhead.
* ADK CLI deploys to Cloud Run by default; YAML shown.
* Debug tip: `adk graph export --format svg` for docs.
* Note license: Apache-2.0, encouraging enterprise adoption.

### 9.2 Context propagation & session state

* ADK `Context` object bundles prior messages, tool outputs, and auth headers. ([google.github.io][30])
* TTL fields auto-expire secrets after hop count to curb leakage. ([google.github.io][30])
* Memory adapters: Redis, Bigtable, in-proc cache selectable via config.
* Live demo: show context diff between two turns in dev-UI.
* Pitfall: large images balloon context; enable mutating middleware to down-sample.
* Students benchmark overhead versus raw LangGraph global dict.
* ID propagation ensures Phoenix spans correlate across hops.
* Frontier: Google pushing Agentspace protocol for cross-vendor context. ([itpro.com][31])
* Tie to Week 10 advanced memory.

---

## Module 10 – Advanced ADK & Deep-Research Agents (Week 10)

### 10.1 Adding conversational memory in ADK

* Redis vector store plugin stores embeddings keyed by conversation ID. ([google.github.io][30])
* Callback fetches top-3 past turns and injects into prompt prefix.
* Hybrid search mixes recency boosting with semantic score.
* Memory improves follow-up answer BLEU by 12 pts in pilot study.
* Live test: ask agent to recall user’s favorite framework.
* Guardrail: flush after 30 days to comply with GDPR.
* Students implement and benchmark recall vs no memory.
* Pitfall: over-stuffing context increases token bill; set max tokens.
* Compare with LangGraph memory node from earlier week.

### 10.2 Using Gemini 2.5 Flash via tool wrappers

* Google blog: 2.5 Flash-Lite halves latency vs 2.0, ideal for high-throughput agents. ([developers.googleblog.com][32])
* ADK tool-wrapper signs requests with user project ID, returns JSON spec. ([google.github.io][29])
* Demo latency: 50 ms first token vs 180 ms GPT-4o on same prompt.
* Cost table: \$0.35/1k tokens vs \$10/1k for GPT-4o.
* Router fallback: error 429 triggers retry to local Mistral.
* Students record p95 latency and include graph in ADR deliverable.
* Note rate limit 600 rpm default—scale orchestrator accordingly.
* Mention upcoming Gemini Code Assist preview. ([blog.google][33])
* Tie into cost routing lessons from Week 4.

---

## Module 11 – Agent Evaluation & Debugging (Week 11)

### 11.1 OpenTelemetry + OpenInference trace schema

* OpenTelemetry GenAI instrumentation auto-captures request/response, token counts. ([opentelemetry.io][22])
* OpenInference adds LLM-specific span keys—route, model, cost. ([github.com][19])
* Phoenix UI consumes OTLP and renders flame graphs of agent chains. ([arize.com][21])
* Demo: visualize Planner-Writer-Reviewer critical path; identify token hog.
* Students tag hallucination spans in Lab 11.
* Alerting: Grafana on span attribute `llm.hallucination=true` over 3 % triggers page.
* Data retention: sample 10 % to keep bill down.
* Privacy: hash user content before export per SOC-2.
* Roadmap: Otel working group drafting `genai` semantic conventions. ([opentelemetry.io][34])

### 11.2 Opik dashboards & Phoenix span replay

* Opik merges scores with traces, offering regression heat maps. ([comet.com][27])
* Phoenix replay loads span tree and re-executes tool calls for deterministic debug. ([arize.com][21])
* Demo bug: missing tool schema causes 400; replay pinpoints bad JSON.
* Students set Slack alert when hallucination > 3 %.
* Snapshot dashboards exported to PNG for course rubric.
* Tip: label router path in span to slice metrics by model.
* Security: Opik masks PII in UI; raw traces remain encrypted.
* Free tier fits class needs; enterprise adds SSO.
* Wrap-up: these skills prep for production deployment next week.

---

## Module 12 – Deploying Agents on Google Cloud (Week 12)

### 12.1 Packaging with Docker + Cloud Build

* Multi-stage Dockerfile keeps image <1 GB by separating build vs runtime.
* Cloud Build triggers on Git tags; YAML shown with `--build-arg MODEL=llama3`.
* Secret Manager mounts API keys at build; never bake into image.
* Artifact Registry stores versioned images; 30-day retention policy demo.
* Build scan highlights OS CVEs—fix before pushing to production.
* Students ship Planner-Writer-Reviewer container in capstone.
* Cost: free tier 120 build-min/month covers labs.
* Debug note: `cloudbuild.yaml` must set `substitutions` for region.
* Lead-in to Vertex deployment next lecture.

### 12.2 Vertex AI AI Applications (Agent Builder) & Agent Engine

* April 2025 rename: Agent Builder → AI Applications; endpoints unchanged. ([cloud.google.com][35])
* Agent Engine GA offers managed runtime, autoscaling and version pinning. ([cloud.google.com][36])
* Deploy via `gcloud ai applications deploy --image gcr.io/...` one-liner.
* Billing: \$0.30/hour per running replica + token fees. ([cloud.google.com][36])
* Observability hooks stream OpenInference spans to Cloud Trace by default.
* Demo blue/green rollout; 5 % traffic canary then full cutover.
* Students must hit 99 % uptime during grading window.
* Terraform module provided; easy teardown to avoid spill-over costs.
* Conclusion: agents live in production with CI, monitoring, cost controls.
