# Agent-Driven Forge

This project is a blueprint for an IDE-less, multi-agent software development system. It draws inspiration from tools like Warp terminal and Claude AI, and concepts from tech visionaries. The system aims to move development into a dynamic, conversational command environment where specialized AI agents collaborate to build, test, and deploy software based on high-level human directives.

## Core Architecture

The system is based on a multi-agent framework:

*   **Orchestrator (Project Manager):** Interfaces with the human developer, breaks down requirements, delegates tasks, and manages the workflow.
*   **Architect:** Designs the system's overall structure, selects technology stack, defines database schema, API contracts, and project file structure.
*   **Coder Agents:** Receive specific coding tasks and write the code according to the Architect's specifications. Multiple Coder Agents can work in parallel.
*   **QA & Debugger Agent:** Analyzes code, performs static analysis, writes and executes tests, identifies bugs, and can attempt fixes.
*   **DevOps Agent:** Handles deployment and infrastructure, including Dockerfiles, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment scripts.
*   **Refactor Agent:** Continuously scans the codebase for improvements in performance, readability, and adherence to best practices, suggesting and applying refactors.

## Human-AI Interface: Intelligent Command Environment (ICE)

The primary interaction point is the Intelligent Command Environment (ICE), a next-generation terminal. Key features include:

*   **Natural Language Prompting:** Developers use plain English to guide the development process.
*   **Real-time Agent Activity Stream:** A live feed of agent activities.
*   **Interactive File System Management:** Browse, review code, and examine artifacts within ICE.
*   **Direct Agent Intervention:** Developers can pause, intervene, and give specific directives.

## Project Structure

*   `/orchestrator`: Contains the Orchestrator Agent logic.
*   `/architect`: Contains the Architect Agent logic.
*   `/coder_agents`: Contains the Coder Agent logic (can support multiple instances).
*   `/qa_debugger_agent`: Contains the QA & Debugger Agent logic.
*   `/devops_agent`: Contains the DevOps Agent logic.
*   `/refactor_agent`: Contains the Refactor Agent logic.
*   `/intelligent_command_environment`: Contains the ICE interface logic.
*   `main.py`: The main script to initialize and run the system (currently a simulation).

## Getting Started (Placeholder)

This is a conceptual blueprint. The `main.py` script runs a basic simulation of the agent interactions.

```bash
python main.py
```

This will demonstrate the initialization of agents and a simulated workflow based on a predefined prompt.
